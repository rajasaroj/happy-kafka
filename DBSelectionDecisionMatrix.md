### **Decision Matrix — 3M Mutually Exclusive Updates in <5 min, No Reader Blocking**

| Criteria                                   | **DB2**                                                                                            | **PostgreSQL**                                                     | **Cassandra / ScyllaDB**                                        | **SingleStore (MemSQL)**                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency model**                      | Lock-based (row-level possible)                                                                    | MVCC (snapshot reads)                                              | Append-only (no locks)                                          | MVCC + lock-free columnstore                                         |
| **Impact of mutually exclusive updates**   | Greatly reduced deadlocks, but still possible lock waits from page-level or table-level contention | No blocking between readers/writers; writers only queue on same PK | No blocking at all — each update is a new write version         | Minimal writer-writer blocking; readers always see a stable snapshot |
| **Reader blocking risk**                   | Medium–Low (UR isolation needed for UI reads)                                                      | Low (MVCC keeps old versions)                                      | None                                                            | Very low                                                             |
| **Deadlock risk**                          | Low with your update pattern                                                                       | Very low                                                           | None                                                            | Very low                                                             |
| **Lock escalation risk**                   | Possible if batches touch many pages; avoid with `LOCKSIZE ROW`, `MAXLOCKS` tuning                 | None                                                               | None                                                            | None                                                                 |
| **Write throughput ceiling (single node)** | High with tuning, but bound by disk I/O and logging                                                | High; depends on WAL flush speed & autovacuum                      | Very high; scales linearly with cluster size                    | Very high; in-memory execution possible                              |
| **Scalability**                            | Mostly vertical                                                                                    | Vertical or sharded with Citus                                     | Horizontal linear scaling                                       | Horizontal scaling + in-memory                                       |
| **Commit strategy impact**                 | Smaller commit batches help reduce log pressure                                                    | Similar; large commits may bloat WAL                               | Irrelevant — commits are local to partition                     | Minimal effect; columnstore flush async                              |
| **Complexity of migration**                | N/A                                                                                                | Low (SQL)                                                          | Medium (No joins; model change)                                 | Medium (Proprietary engine)                                          |
| **Best fit if**                            | You must keep DB2 and can tune locks                                                               | You want ACID + no read blocking                                   | You want scale + zero lock concerns, eventual consistency is OK | You want HTAP speed + lock-free OLTP                                 |

### **Key Implications with Mutually Exclusive Updates**

1. **Your biggest risk moves from deadlocks → I/O and log throughput**.
   Even if no two updates touch the same row, DB2 and PostgreSQL still must:

    * Log the change to disk (redo log / WAL)
    * Maintain indexes
    * Possibly trigger page flushes

2. **DB2**: Will likely handle it if:

    * Use **row-level locking**
    * Tune `LOCKLIST` & `MAXLOCKS`
    * Keep commit batches small enough to avoid log bottlenecks
    * UI queries run under **`WITH UR`** (uncommitted read) or skip locked pages

3. **PostgreSQL**:

    * MVCC guarantees no reader blocking
    * Your updates will generate 3M *new row versions*, so **autovacuum tuning** is critical to avoid bloat
    * WAL write rate could become your only bottleneck — SSD + high `max_wal_size` help

4. **Cassandra / ScyllaDB**:

    * Will breeze through the updates — each update is a new immutable write
    * No locks, no blockages, but queries must be designed for wide-column model
    * Eventual consistency might be a dealbreaker for strict financial reconciliations

5. **SingleStore**:

    * Columnstore + MVCC gives near-instant reads while updating
    * In-memory processing + distributed commits could easily meet the 5-min SLA
    * High licensing cost, but fits the “speed without blocking” requirement

### **Summary Table — Bottleneck Type by DB**

| DB Engine   | Main Bottleneck After Removing Lock Conflicts  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| DB2         | Transaction log write rate + index maintenance |
| PostgreSQL  | WAL write rate + table bloat (vacuum)          |
| Cassandra   | None on locking; network / disk bandwidth only |
| SingleStore | Network / memory bandwidth                     |

💡 **If I had to rank for your "mutually exclusive + no reader blocking" constraint:**

1. **PostgreSQL** (MVCC + strong ACID, minimal migration pain)
2. **SingleStore** (if budget allows and you want instant analytics)
3. **Cassandra/ScyllaDB** (if you can trade strict consistency for massive scale)
4. **DB2** (works but will need serious tuning to hit <5min consistently)

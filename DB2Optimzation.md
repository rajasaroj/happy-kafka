| Area                         | Parameter / Setting                     | Default (approx)     | Recommended for your case               | Why it matters                                                        |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Logging**                  | `LOGFILSIZ` (log file size in 4K pages) | 4096 (16MB)          | 32768–65536 (128–256MB)                 | Bigger log files = fewer switches during update storm.                |
|                              | `LOGPRIMARY`                            | 13                   | 30–50                                   | Enough primary logs to handle 3GB+ of log without going to secondary. |
|                              | `LOGSECOND`                             | 12                   | 50+ (or `-1` for auto)                  | Prevents “log full” stalls mid-batch.                                 |
|                              | `LOGBUFSZ` (log buffer)                 | 256–1024             | 8192–16384                              | Larger buffer allows grouping of log writes.                          |
|                              | `MINCOMMIT`                             | 1                    | 1–5 (test)                              | Allows group commit; trade-off: slightly higher durability window.    |
| **Locking**                  | Table lock size                         | PAGE (often default) | ROW (`ALTER TABLE ... LOCKSIZE ROW`)    | Prevents page locks and escalation.                                   |
|                              | `LOCKLIST`                              | \~4096               | 50000+                                  | Holds more concurrent row locks in memory.                            |
|                              | `MAXLOCKS`                              | 10%                  | 30–50%                                  | Avoids escalation to table lock when many row locks are held.         |
|                              | `DLCHKTIME`                             | 60 sec               | Lower (10–20 sec)                       | Detects deadlocks faster so retries are faster.                       |
| **Bufferpool & Tablespaces** | Bufferpool size                         | Often small shared   | Dedicated BP for this table: 2–4 GB min | Avoids contention with other workloads.                               |
|                              | Page size                               | 4K                   | 8K or 16K                               | Matches update row size better, fewer pages fetched.                  |
|                              | Tablespace container placement          | Mixed                | Dedicated NVMe                          | Removes I/O competition with other objects.                           |
| **Indexing**                 | Drop/rebuild                            | Keep all indexes     | Drop non-critical before update         | Reduces index maintenance overhead during updates.                    |
| **Batching & Commit**        | Commit frequency                        | Large or 1 txn       | Every 1k–5k rows per thread             | Frees locks, reduces log contention, avoids giant transactions.       |
| **Concurrency**              | Batch ranges                            | Random overlap       | Disjoint key ranges per thread          | Eliminates page-level contention.                                     |
| **Monitoring**               | `db2pd -logs`                           | —                    | Watch log usage in real time            | Prevents log-full stalls.                                             |
|                              | `db2pd -locks`                          | —                    | Spot blocking patterns                  | Quick root cause checks if throughput drops.                          |
